# Keylogger

## Objective
The Keylogger Project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting keylogging attacks. The project focused on developing a system to monitor, analyze, and identify keylogging activity through log analysis and behavior pattern recognition, enhancing the understanding of attack detection and defense mechanisms

### Skills Learned

- Develop proficiency in writing scripts.
- Analyzing keylogger software to understand its functionality and detection methods.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Visual Studio Code for writing the code.
- Python language for developing keylogger functionality.
- pynput for capturing keyboard inputs.
